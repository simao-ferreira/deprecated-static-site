Summary: Static site generators on the wild

## Besides pelican what else?

I knew of [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) from my previous foray into github static pages, it is a neat framework, easy
to set up, runs on ruby which I don't know much of, and it became difficult to maintain. That was the extent of what I
kew regarding the topic.

Turns out, there are plenty to look into.

I am not very comfortable around the front-end stack, I had the opportunity to work occasionally in some front-end
frameworks and tools but JS overall is still a very foreign concept for me. As such I did not consider any JavaScript
framework for static site generators. I know there are quite some of them with awesome support, but it was not what I
was looking for.

One of the ones I have eared a lot is [Hugo](https://gohugo.io/), to be honest is an impressive project, fast and
elegant, easy to install and with hundreds of themes. I considered one of the most viable options, downsides for me, I
never worked on Go, and although I imagine there would be no issue working with it, I was looking for something that
would mean a smaller learning curve.

[MkDocs](https://www.mkdocs.org/) also scored highly with me, very simple and straight-forward looking framework, based
on python, it's utility is mostly for documentation purposes. Writing documentation is also something I want to explore
but this time around I was looking for something more mundane, blog-like.

A very similar project was [Sphinx](https://www.sphinx-doc.org/en/master/), this one I knew of, since is used largely in
documentation for python packages.

I also looked into [Hyde](https://hyde.github.io/), a nice looking framework with similar approach to Pelican, but it
does not look to be in development anymore, runs on python 2.
