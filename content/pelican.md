Summary: Starting on Pelican

## Pelican

I was looking to create a static site for my GitHub profile for a while, I gave my try to the
famous [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) that GitHub recommends and supports, it was not hard to set up, if used with a
theme getting a beautiful looking site is pretty straight forward.

Jekyll runs on ruby, I have no prior experience running stuff on ruby, it was not difficult to make it run, but a little
harder to maintain and improve, added that I also wanted to play around with css and setting up my own theme, it became
clear to me really fast this was not going to be very fun to play with. Eventually I got bored and it fell to oblivion.

Recently I have been learning - read playing - more and more with python, and I've become very fond of this incredible
versatile tool.

So when I decided to take a look around for alternatives, python static site generators caught my eye and from the bunch
[pelican](https://blog.getpelican.com/) seemed very simple and practical to implement, it uses markdown files for content generations and can also use
reStructuredText, it works nicely with html, css and even js, there are a significant number of themes going around to
take as example to create my own. So only nice prospects.

And did I mention it runs on python? I was already sold :)
